Various data structures and algorithms exercises that I have used to learn DSA concepts and relearn the basics.

- Files prefixed with `ctci` are my personal implementations of problems from [Cracking The Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/).
- Files prefixed with `dv` are from the fantastic [Data Structures and Algorithms with Visualizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iCHf7OZn6c&list=PL6Zs6LgrJj3tDXv8a_elC6eT_4R5gfX4d) series by Dinesh Varyani. This is a YouTube playlist that explains DSA concepts in great detail and in plain language, step by step.
- Files prefixed with `hr` are various HackerRank problems, with links to the actual problem at the very top of the file.
